    "## SQLAlchemy ORM\n",
    "One of the primary features of SQLAlchemy is the Object Relational Mapper, which is commonly referred to as ORM. ORM allows you to create classes in your code that can be mapped to specific tables in a given database. This allows us to create a special type of system called a decoupled system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand ORMs and decoupled systems, consider the following scenario. Suppose you are cleaning out the garage, and you find a bunch of wires or ropes that are all knotted together. We would call this a tightly coupled system: all of the different ropes are connected to each other, so if we go to grab just one, the whole mess comes along with it. What the ORM does for us is untangle—or decouple—all of those ropes, so we can use just one of them at a time. When we pick one up, we won't pick up the whole knot; or, if one element breaks, it doesn't affect any of the other cords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, the less coupling in our code, the better. If there are a bunch of relationships between all of your coding components and one of them breaks, everything breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ORM helps us keep our systems decoupled. We'll get into more specific details about how we can keep our code decoupled, but for now, just remember that your references will be to classes in your code instead of specific tables in the database, and that we'll be able to influence each class independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQLAlchemy Create Engine\n",
    "Another really great feature of SQLAlchemy is the `create engine` function. This function's primary purpose is to set up the ability to query a SQLite database. After all, data just sitting in a database that we can't access does us no good.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to connect to our SQLite database, we need to use the `create_engine()` function. This function doesn't actually connect to our database; it just prepares the database file to be connected to later on.\n",
